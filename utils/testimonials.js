    long: 'To Whom It May Concern, </br> </br> I am the Head Teacher of Frontend Development at Future Games in Stockholm. It is in this capacity that I first met Davide, and it is my pleasure to recommend Davide for any development position. </br> </br>Over the two years of the course, Davide has grown into an extremely competent and dedicated developer, but his growth as a leader has been equally impressive. His willingness to embrace any challenge and to dig deep into finding a solution quicky displayed his natural aptitude for programming, and his work within the various group projects has proven he has natural leadership and mentoring abilities.</br> </br> Davide’s biggest assets are professionalism and a true enthusiasm to learn and grow – my course teaches React/Next and web development, Davide has not only shown he is comfortable with the course material, he has also delved into several technologies that we do not cover in this course. His thesis project was written in Vue using Websockets to create a real time multi player online game that is well beyond what can be expected of a student in my education.</br> </br>In summary, I would not hesitate to recommend Davide for any development position. His professionalism, passion for learning and leadership qualities will greatly benefit any development team and organisation. Please don’t hesitate to contact me with any questions.',
