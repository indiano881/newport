        Hi, I’m <strong>Davide Baldi</strong> — a passionate and driven <strong>Fullstack Developer</strong> based in Stockholm, Sweden. My expertise lies in building modern, responsive, and user-focused web applications with clean code and thoughtful design.

        After several years in the restaurant industry, I made the bold decision to change my career path in 2022. While I enjoyed working with people, I wanted a future that allowed me to build things, solve complex problems, and work on innovative products. That’s when I dove head-first into tech — and I’ve never looked back.
