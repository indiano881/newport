      <p class="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Hi, I’m <strong>Davide Baldi</strong> — a passionate and driven <strong>Fullstack Developer</strong> based in Stockholm, Sweden. My expertise lies in building modern, responsive, and user-focused web applications with clean code and thoughtful design.

      <p class="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        After several years in the restaurant industry, I made the bold decision to change my career path in 2022. While I enjoyed working with people, I wanted a future that allowed me to build things, solve complex problems, and work on innovative products. That’s when I dove head-first into tech — and I’ve never looked back.
      </p>
  
      <p class="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        I’m currently finishing my education as a frontend app developer at <strong>Changemaker Educations</strong>, where I’ve had the opportunity to learn deeply about frontend frameworks, backend services, DevOps, and cloud integrations. I've also worked as a Scrum Master and Product Owner during our agile projects.
